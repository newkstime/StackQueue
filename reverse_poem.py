    You are given a pessimistic poem as a group of phrases. 
    The phrases are in strings separated by pound signs: '#'.
    1. Create a single string from this group of phrases.
    2. Next, split the string of phrases into a Python list 
       of phrases using the string split method.
    3. Display the poem by walking through the list and 
       displaying each phrase one per line.
    4. And, at the same time, place each phrase on a Queue. 
    5. After all the phrases have been placed on the Queue, 
       transfer the phrases from the Queue to a Stack.
    6. Then, remove them from the Stack and, at the same time, 
       and display the phrases, one per line.
    The result is another now optimistic poem with the phrases reversed.
